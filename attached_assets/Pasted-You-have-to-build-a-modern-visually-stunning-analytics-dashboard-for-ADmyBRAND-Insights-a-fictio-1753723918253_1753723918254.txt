You have to build a modern, visually stunning analytics dashboard for “ADmyBRAND Insights” (a fictional analytics platform for digital marketing agencies).

The dashboard should showcase key business metrics, charts, and a data table in an interactive and responsive way.

🎯 Core Requirements
1️⃣ Overview Page (Key Metrics Cards)
Display at least 4 metric cards:

Revenue

Users

Conversions

Growth %

Each card should have:

Title

Value

Growth indicator (positive/negative arrow or percentage)

2️⃣ Interactive Charts (Minimum 3 Types)
Add three different charts to visualize data:

Line Chart – e.g., Revenue growth over months

Bar Chart – e.g., Users by region/month

Pie/Donut Chart – e.g., Conversions by marketing channel

Charts must be interactive (hover tooltips, legends, etc.).

3️⃣ Data Table
Include a data table that supports:

Sorting (e.g., by name, date, revenue)

Filtering/Search

Pagination (to handle multiple records)

4️⃣ Responsive Design
The dashboard must look perfect on:

Desktop

Tablet

Mobile

🎨 UI/UX Requirements (Highly Weighted – 40%)
Use a modern design system (consistent colors, spacing, typography).

Ensure clear visual hierarchy (sections should be well organized).

Include smooth animations (micro-interactions, hover effects, loading states).

Bonus: Add a Dark/Light Mode Toggle.

⚡ Technical Implementation
Framework: Next.js 14+ (React-based)

UI Library: MUI (Material UI), shadcn/ui, or Chakra UI

Charts: Recharts (or any other chart library)

Data: Use mock data or a public API

Architecture: Build reusable components (MetricCard, Chart, Table, etc.)

🌟 Bonus Features (Optional but Impressive)
Real-time Updates (simulate using setInterval)

Export Data (CSV/PDF export option)

Advanced Filters (e.g., Date Range picker)

Loading Skeletons (show while data is “loading”)

📋 Deliverables
You need to submit:

GitHub Repository with clean, well-documented code.

Live Demo Link (deploy on Vercel or Netlify – highly recommended).

AI Usage Report (200-300 words explaining how you used AI tools).

(Optional) You can also showcase this project in your portfolio.
